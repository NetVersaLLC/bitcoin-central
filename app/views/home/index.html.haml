This means they will not become unstable. Bitcoins are open-source, which means nobody owns them and that Bitcoins are decentralized. There are no banks or institutions of any sort involved in the exchange of Bitcoins. This makes the cost much lower for the buyer and seller. There is no fine print or limits to transactions when you use Bitcoins because they are not regulated through a bank.
